# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
head(cocktail)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
sep_cocktail <- cocktail %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)

ingre <- gsub("[^A-Za-z ]","", sep_cocktail$ingredients)
ingre_clean <- ingre %>%
  gsub("  oz ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" bsp ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" dash ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" dashes ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" drop ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" drops ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" oz ","", .) %>%
  gsub("  abv","", .)
sep_cocktail$ingredients <- ingre_clean

cocktail_fix <- sep_cocktail %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = str_to_lower(ingredients))
cocktail_fix
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_name <- cocktail_fix %>%
  arrange(ingredients) %>%
  distinct(ingredients)
ingredients_name
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
count(ingredients_name)
```
There are 63 unique ingredients

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = T) %>% 
  top_n(10)

top10_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(name, sort = T) %>% 
  top_n(1)
most_ingredients
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n == 1)
count(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
only_one <- cocktail_fix %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n() == 1)

cocktail_one <- unique(only_one$name)
cocktail_one
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
many_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n() != 1)

cocktail_many <- unique(many_ingredients$name)
cocktail_many
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cs <- table(cocktail_fix$name, cocktail_fix$ingredients)
cs <- ifelse(cs != 0, "X", "")
cs
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
