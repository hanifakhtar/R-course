# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.


```r
cocktail <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

```
## 
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## cols(
##   name = col_character(),
##   abv = col_double(),
##   acid = col_double(),
##   sugar = col_double(),
##   type = col_character(),
##   index = col_double(),
##   instructions = col_character(),
##   ingredients = col_character(),
##   ncotw = col_character()
## )
```

```r
head(cocktail)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 9
##   name     abv  acid sugar type   index instructions     ingredients    ncotw   
##   <chr>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  <dbl> <chr>            <chr>          <chr>

## 2 Pink ~  12.4  0.64   9   eggwh~     6 Dry shake, shak~ 1 1/2 oz Plym~ "not ye~
## 3 Clove~  13.6  0.49   6.7 eggwh~     7 Dry shake, shak~ 2 oz Plymouth~ "<a hre~
## 4 Whisk~  15.2  0.53   7.1 eggwh~     8 Dry shake, shak~ 2 oz rye (50%~ "not ye~

## 6 Honey~  15    0.85   8.9 shaken    10 Shake, coupe. G~ 2 oz white ru~ "<a hre~
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.


```r
sep_cocktail <- cocktail %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)

ingre <- gsub("[^A-Za-z ]","", sep_cocktail$ingredients)
ingre_clean <- ingre %>%
  gsub("  oz ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" bsp ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" dash ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" dashes ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" drop ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" drops ","", .) %>%
  gsub(" oz ","", .) %>%
  gsub("  abv","", .)
sep_cocktail$ingredients <- ingre_clean

cocktail_fix <- sep_cocktail %>% 
  mutate(ingredients = str_to_lower(ingredients))
cocktail_fix
```

```

## # ... with 213 more rows
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.


```r
ingredients_name <- cocktail_fix %>%
  arrange(ingredients) %>%
  distinct(ingredients)
ingredients_name
```

```
## # A tibble: 63 x 1
##    ingredients                   
##    <chr>                         
##  1 absinthe                      
##  2 absolut citron vodka          
##  3 agarclarified grapefruit juice
##  4 amer picon                    
##  5 angostura bitters             
##  6 apple brandy                  
##  7 benedictine                   
##  8 blanco tequila                
##  9 bourbon                       
## 10 campari                       
## # ... with 53 more rows
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?


```r
count(ingredients_name)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##       n
##   <int>
## 1    63
```
There are 63 unique ingredients

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.


```r
top10_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = T) %>% 
  top_n(10)
```

```
## Selecting by n
```

```r
top10_ingredients
```

```
## # A tibble: 11 x 2
##    ingredients            n
##    <chr>              <int>
##  1 lemon juice           15
##  2 simple syrup          14
##  3 sweet vermouth        13
##  4 angostura bitters     12
##  5 gin                   12
##  6 lime juice            12
##  7 saline solution       10
##  8 water                 10
##  9 rye                    8
## 10 cognac                 6
## 11 luxardo maraschino     6
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.


```r
most_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(name, sort = T) %>% 
  top_n(1)
```

```
## Selecting by n
```

```r
most_ingredients
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   name                   n
##   <chr>              <int>
## 1 Blender Margarita      6
## 2 Carbonated Negroni     6
## 3 Clover Club            6
## 4 De La Louisiane        6
## 5 Pink Lady              6
## 6 Vieux Carre            6
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?


```r
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_fix %>%
  count(ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n == 1)
count(rare_ingredients)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##       n
##   <int>
## 1    29
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?


```r
only_one <- cocktail_fix %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% 
  filter(n() == 1)

cocktail_one <- unique(only_one$name)
cocktail_one
```

```
##  [1] "Pisco Sour"                        "Pink Lady"

  filter(n() != 1)

cocktail_many <- unique(many_ingredients$name)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:


```r
cheatsheet <- table(cocktail_fix$name, cocktail_fix$ingredients)
cheatsheet <- ifelse(cheatsheet == 0, "","x")
cheatsheet
```

```
